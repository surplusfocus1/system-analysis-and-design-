The design platform is conceived to transform the way individuals discover, select, and acquire designs for a myriad of applications, ranging from personalized clothing and accessories to bespoke wall art and digital assets for websites and applications. This platform is meticulously crafted to cater to two primary user roles: Artists/Designers and Buyers.


# platform workflow 

## Artists/Designers:
  - Design Submission: Artists and designers are empowered to upload and curate an extensive collection of their creative designs on the platform. This functionality enables them to showcase their work to a 
  global audience.
  - Design Availability: Each uploaded design becomes accessible for purchase by buyers, providing artists with a valuable opportunity to monetize their creations and gain visibility in the marketplace.
## Buyers:

  - Design Exploration: Buyers can navigate through a diverse and dynamic catalog of designs available on the platform. The user-friendly interface facilitates an engaging browsing experience.
  - Design Selection: Upon finding a design that aligns with their needs, buyers can specify their preferences regarding how the design should be utilized or printed, whether it be on clothing, bags, wall 
    frames, or for digital use.
  - Transaction Processing: Payments are securely processed through the platform, ensuring a streamlined and efficient transaction process for buyers.
  - Artist Compensation: Following the completion of a purchase, the platform orchestrates the transfer of funds to the artist, ensuring they are fairly compensated for their creative contributions.

The project has successfully completed the analysis phase, which includes the development of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) up to Level 3. The next step involves transitioning to the implementation phase. This phase will focus on developing a website based on the established database blueprint, integrating the database with the user interface, and ensuring all functionalities are aligned with the platform's requirements.
