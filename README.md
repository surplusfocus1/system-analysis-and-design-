# system analysis 


The design platform is intended to facilitate the selection and purchase of designs for various applications, such as clothing, bags, wall frames, or digital assets for websites and applications. The platform supports two primary user roles: Artists/Designers and Buyers.


# platform workflow 

Artists/Designers:
  Artists can upload multiple designs to the platform.
  Each design is available for purchase by users.
Buyers:
  Buyers browse through available designs on the platform.
  They select a design and specify how they want it printed or used.
  Payment is made to the company through the platform.
  The company subsequently compensates the artist for their design.

  # Current Status:

The project has successfully completed the analysis phase, which includes the development of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) up to Level 3. The next step involves transitioning to the implementation phase. This phase will focus on developing a website based on the established database blueprint, integrating the database with the user interface, and ensuring all functionalities are aligned with the platform's requirements.
